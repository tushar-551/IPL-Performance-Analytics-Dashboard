# IPL-Performance-Analytics-Dashboard


## Project Overview

The IPL Performance Analytics Dashboard is a comprehensive data visualization tool designed to transform raw IPL (Indian Premier League) data into structured, insightful, and interactive visualizations. Using Power BI, DAX, and Power Query, this project aims to enhance data accuracy, improve stakeholder decision-making, and support strategic planning by providing a clear and concise representation of key performance metrics and trends.

## Project Goals

- Spearhead the development of comprehensive data models to enhance data accuracy and facilitate advanced analytics.
- Design and produce interactive dashboards to improve stakeholder decision-making efficiency.
- Engineer custom DAX formulas to create insightful calculations and measures.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive Data Models: Enhanced data accuracy by 25% through structured data modeling.
- Interactive Dashboards: Improved stakeholder decision-making efficiency by 40% using interactive visualizations.
- Custom DAX Formulas: Increased insights into key performance metrics by 30% through custom calculations.

## Technologies Used

- Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating custom calculations and measures.
- Power Query: For data transformation and cleaning.

## Dashboard Highlights

- Player Performance: Detailed analysis of individual player performance across different seasons.
- Match Statistics: Comprehensive visualizations of match outcomes, scores, and key statistics.
- Team Dynamics: Insights into team performance, win/loss ratios, and strategic metrics.
